You're here.

The Blakerspace.

What happens when the web meets weeb? When Medium and LinkedIn are too pretentious, but this is somehow acceptable? When professional and personal are inextricably linked like an overshare at the christmas party?

Where songs you discover are anime openings and so you watch the anime and it's also good.

A place in Sydney that serves The Premium Malt's.

Where the decisions matter so little that any

thing is enough to get you to make a choice of something to do.

This is the minmax limbo you end up in when you are sick of losing but also realise it's not worth the effort to improve.

It's the forbidden area between the door and the wall that could jam your fingies but it can't cause it's unhinged.

It's where you commit to making garbage as the first step to making something good. Say it with me: "Yes, I will produce garbage." Stinko

It's my blog mostly
