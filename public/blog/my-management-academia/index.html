In 2018, a catastrophic error in Workday enrolled me into My Management Academy, a high school for developers who want to become managers. Only a handful of students make it to the management track, and if I fail, I&rsquo;m gonna get fired for sure!</p><p>Do I have what it takes to overcome the odds and Track Change™ my destiny? Who knows… wish me luck!</p><h2 id=anime-was-a-mistake>Anime was a mistake</h2><p>Okay, let me try again. In 2018 I made the transition from being individual contributor software developer to engineering manager. In many companies, there is little official process or formal training behind such a transition. Too many people simply get thrown into the deep end of the role and find themselves in what can be an emotionally confronting situation. You quickly go from the comfort of your individual contributor role to making less-reversible decisions in areas you don&rsquo;t have complete confidence in, having people rely upon you, and having way more meetings.</p><p>Becoming a manager is picking up a whole new job, and can be scary. I wrote this blog one year after starting the transition to management and published it intnerally at Atlassian, where I worked at the time. It might not be reflective of how everyone has handled similar transitions, but it is based on my authentic experience. I hope this illuminates what the change to management entails, and addresses some common challenges new managers face.</p><h1 id=timeline>Timeline</h1><p>My experience could be roughly divided up into the following phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Considered becoming a manager practically from the time I had to fix my first build early in my career.</li><li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Joined new team with an opportunity for leadership August 2017</li><li><strong>Early life:</strong> Started the role in a trial capacity about January 2018</li><li><strong>Mid-life crisis:</strong> July 2018</li><li><strong>Finale:</strong> Team lead officially in October 2018</li></ul><h2 id=consideration>Consideration</h2><h3 id=my-personal-recount>My personal recount</h3><p>After a couple of years being a developer, I was frustrated with builds. Despite being on a front-end team—where the customer impact of your work is extremely obvious—I was craving more. The details of development started to become frustrating instead of fun. Build issues, legacy code, tech debt, and refactoring, started to feel like they were getting in the way of enjoying work.</p><p>However, when considering becoming a manager, I regret focussing too much on these &ldquo;push&rdquo; forces. What’s more important is pull forces, or &ldquo;motivators&rdquo; towards the management role. There are many roles that don’t involve refactoring or fixing builds, so there needs to be more than just push forces.</p><p>What pulled me towards management in the end was a personal goal: I wanted to be <em>capable</em> of being a leader. I didn&rsquo;t feel capable at the time: I noticed when even making small decisions as an engineer, say, during a planning meeting, I’d have a mini panic attack internally. How did my manager do this everyday? I wanted to be able to do what they do.</p><p>In addition to that, after thinking about it, I liked the balance of technical and product-oriented thinking involved in the engineering manager role, and the ability to contribute to people’s growth. Everyone remembers their favourite high school teacher and the impact they had—I think managers are the same—and I liked the idea of being able to have that impact on someone’s life. After understanding the motivators, I decided yep, I wanna try this thing out.</p><h3 id=consideration-phase-summary>Consideration phase summary</h3><ul><li><strong>Feelings:</strong> restless, unfulfilled, drive, ambition</li></ul><h3 id=at-the-beginning-of-this-stage-start-doing>At the beginning of this stage, start doing:</h3><ul><li><strong>Be a strong individual contributor:</strong> In general, I recommend being at a senior level of your craft before trying for management. As a leader, you&rsquo;ll be interacting with a wide range of people about your craft, so a solid foundation is helpful.</li><li><strong>Introspection:</strong> have a good old fashioned think about: your role, what you like and dislike, what you’re missing from your current role, and if you’re happy.</li><li><strong>Information gathering:</strong> try to get an insight in what your leaders do</li><li><strong>Get a taste of the role:</strong> mentoring is a great way to do this.</li></ul><h3 id=by-the-end-of-this-stage-you-should>By the end of this stage, you should:</h3><p><em>(aka “signals that you’re ready for the next stage”)</em></p><ul><li>Commit to wanting to try the role</li><li>Communicate and be open about that to your manager and peers, who can help you find opportunities and share responsibilities</li><li>Keep an eye open for management opportunities</li></ul><h2 id=opportunity>Opportunity</h2><h3 id=my-personal-recount-1>My personal recount</h3><p>A company restructure proved timely for a chance to look for a team with leadership opportunities. It was important that I was open and clear about that; it meant that people could point me to teams with open roles that I was looking for. After joining such a team, their Real Manager helped me start picking up more responsibilities: running agile ceremonies like standup, planning meeting, and participating in more strategic stuff.</p><p>At this time, I was still doing regular engineer work plus these other responsibilities. Time management was starting to become important, I found myself feeling a bit stretched and needing all the hours of every workday, and more, to get stuff done. In hindsight, this was because I put too much on my own plate.</p><p>The org chart can be confusing in such setups—myself and the other engineers were all reporting to Real Manager—but Real Manager wasn’t really involved in the day-to-day work. The unclear responsibilities were between myself and Real Manager was further amplified by the fact that I started doing 1-1s with the team.</p><p>I think this was a mental inflection point—starting to do 1-1s—so I’m going to talk about it a bit more. It was very awkward for me to start doing these; I’m thankful that the team was very supportive and keen to start doing them. What helped me was thinking that there’s no harm in offering to do 1-1s, so I approached everyone individually saying “Hey, since I’m more involved day-to-day than , would you like to have 1-1s with me as well?”</p><p>It&rsquo;s good to be open and explain that you want the practice and are trying management stuff out. Given that you’re doing other responsibilities like planning and standup and stuff, it’s probably obvious anyway.</p><h3 id=opportunity-phase-summary>Opportunity phase summary</h3><ul><li><strong>Feelings:</strong> time-poor, lots of things going on, imposter syndrome, excitement, learning a lot</li></ul><h3 id=at-the-beginning-of-this-stage-start-doing-1>At the beginning of this stage, start doing:</h3><ul><li><strong>Take feature lead opportunities and some responsibilities of your current team lead.</strong> This may be hard depending on the team, so consider switching it up.</li><li><strong>Have a shared understanding with your team that you are trying this out.</strong> Pick up light responsibilities: standup, planning, etc. basically take stuff off your manager’s hands related to your group of people.</li><li><strong>When planning the sprint’s work, count yourself as half time dev or even less.</strong> This will be really hard to do at first because when you are planning and have the capability to do it, you will want to commit to getting it done.</li></ul><h3 id=by-the-end-of-this-stage-you-should-1>By the end of this stage, you should:</h3><ul><li>Consider going back to your previous role. It’s still a bit early to know if leadership is not for you at this stage, but if you really really dislike the extra responsibilities, begin the transition back.</li><li>Have picked up more serious responsibilities: doing 1-1s, being the contact point for your team, working directly with other leaders to progress projects.</li><li>Have a shared understanding with the team about your role and your Real Manager’s role.</li><li>Be doing close to zero hands-on development.</li></ul><h2 id=early-life>Early life</h2><h3 id=my-personal-recount-2>My personal recount</h3><p>I’ll be real, this was one of the hardest times of my life. It was like learning how to breathe again. This 6 months was spent wrangling a high impact project that had a lot of stakeholders. There were a lot of ‘firsts’ in this time period, like running big cross-team project kick-offs, dealing with reporting upwards, measuring team success, and more serious 1-1s.</p><p>Damb, those early 1-1s are hard. The feeling, the first time you’re sitting there, and realising it’s up to you to drive this conversation? Terrifying. Oh lord, my manager, grand-manager, and the CEO are subscribed to notifications on my project updates. I have no idea what to type. Should I say iy&rsquo;s at-risk? What if I pick the wrong estimated ship date? Terrifying.</p><p>Everything has suddenly become difficult, confusing, and scary. Even things you took for granted—like knowing what you’ve done in the day—becomes another challenge, and you have to learn it all from zero.</p><p>No engineering work meant no longer having work tracked for free in tickets. I started using Todoist as a “things I need to action” list. If I didn’t do that, I would frequently just forget and have to apologise for &ldquo;dropping the ball&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s what you say in Business. I felt like I would start the day with 5 todos, complete 3, and end the day with 7; while at the end of the day having no idea what I accomplished.</p><p>I flubbed (made mistakes) a lot. I often could not sleep because I was trying to work out “well if we got X person doing Y thing then maybe we could get this done on time”. This was extra frustrating because I knew this was not how you manage a team (at 1am while lying in bed), but I couldn’t stop myself.</p><p>I leaned heavily on my manager as a therapist. This was useful. About once a fortnight I’d ask “If I wanted to go back to being an engineer, how would I go about that?” and, bless him, he would just shake his head and be like “so we’re having this conversation again,” and coach me on how to solve whatever problem I was having that week.</p><h3 id=early-life-phase-summary>Early life phase summary</h3><h3 id=at-the-beginning-of-this-stage-start-doing-2>At the beginning of this stage, start doing:</h3><ul><li>All management responsibilities.</li><li>Delegating more project work: this is a win-win, you help individuals improve and take more responsibility, and you improve your coaching abilities.</li><li>Navigating through problems using the feelings matrix below.</li></ul><h3 id=by-the-end-of-this-stage-you-should-2>By the end of this stage, you should:</h3><ul><li>Continue to consider going back to your previous role. Be really careful here—in terms of personal growth and rate of learning, this is a peak. Before reverting back, try taking some leave. Reflect on, and really understand your feelings about the role.</li><li>Feel comfortable with most of the stuff described in the feelings matrix below.</li></ul></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between items-center"></div><hr class=my-6><div class="flex justify-center items-center flex-wrap"><a href=mailto:yaboy@blakerspace.net title=email class="bg-black rounded-full p-3 mx-2 my-2 transform hover:scale-110 active:scale-90 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out"><img src=/icons/email.svg alt="email icon" class="w-4 h-4 md:w-6 md:h-6 blend-diff"></a></div><div class=mt-6></div></main><div class="absolute bottom-0 w-full"><footer class="w-full h-24 text-center text-xs text-gray-400 bg-black relative"><div class="w-full px-6 md:pt-0 md:mx-auto md:max-w-5xl flex flex-1 space-between items-center absolute-center"><a href=https://blakerspace.net/ class=absolute><div class="w-8 h-8 relative font-bold bg-white blend-diff"><h1 class="absolute-center m-0 font-charter text-2xl text-gray-100 blend-diff select-none">B</h1></div></a><div class="h-full flex-1"><span class=select-none><a href=https://github.com/negrel/hugo-theme-pico class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-200 no-underline">Pico</a>
